    </header>

<p>marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world?
that must be so confusing for a little girl.
and i know you're going to need me here with you.</p>

<p class="highlight">but i'm losing myself, and i'm afraid you're gonna lose me too.
</p>

<p>this magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy,
    and i need to save you, but who's going to save me?</p>
    
<p>please forgive me for whatever i do,
    when i don't remember you.</p>

<p>marceline, i can feel myself slipping away.
    i can't remember what it made me say.
    but i remember that i saw you frown.
    i swear it wasn't me, it was the crown.</p>
