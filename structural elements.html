        <h1>DIARY OF A COOL KID</h1>
        <p>RODRICK'S DIARY. NO GREG & MANNY HEFFLEY ALLOWED!</p>

        <h2>FIRST ENTRY</h2>
        <p>Febuary 9, 2009</p>

        <p>My mom told me that she'd pay me $10 weekly if I started writing on this crappy diary. She said it
            would help fix my "problems". I don't know what the heck she meant by problems, but since I'll be
            receiving money, I'll do it. I  asked Greg what to write since he's always sulking around jotting 
            on that silly notebook of his. I'm gonna have to get used this, I guess.
        </p>

        <h2>SECOND ENTRY</h2>
        <p>Febuary 11, 2009</p>

        <p>So turns out Heather Hills is a player??? That is so sick, and by sick, I mean really sick (in a bad
        way basically). I feel so bad for her boyfriend. I'm happy she rejected me back in 2008, cuz I would get
        really pissed if I found she was snogging some rando who was 2 years older than me! What's she doing 
        hanging out with a college student anyways? If Greg actually sees this diary, I'm warning you right now not
        to go for that Holly girl. Never trust any of those Hill people.
        </p>
